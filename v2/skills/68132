Infuse the magical essence of bliss into an elixir, gaining resolution and converting conditions on yourself into life force, and then toss the elixir at the targeted area, corrupting a boon on targets into a condition. If you are in the splash area of the elixir, gain Blight.\n\nIf you are at or above the Blight threshold when you activate this skill, consume that amount of Blight to double the damage and corrupt an additional boon on targets.",
